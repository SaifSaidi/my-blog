## Getting Started with BlazorImage

Integrating BlazorImage into your Blazor project is straightforward.

### ‚úÖ Requirements

  * [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or later.
  * Currently supports **local images only**. Remote image support is planned for future releases.
  * Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) is **not yet supported**.

### üì¶ Installation

BlazorImage is available on NuGet:

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package BlazorImage --version 1.0.4
```

**Or, add a PackageReference to your `.csproj` file:**

```xml
<PackageReference Include="BlazorImage" Version="1.0.4" />
```

### üß© Setup Instructions

1.  **Import the Namespace:**
    Add the following to your `_Imports.razor` file:

    ```csharp
    @using BlazorImage
    ```

2.  **Register Services:**
    In your `Program.cs` file, register the BlazorImage services:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddBlazorImage();
    ```

    You can customize various options:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddBlazorImage(options =>
    {
        // Output directory for optimized images (relative to wwwroot). Default: "_optimized"
        options.OutputDir = "optimized-assets"; // Example: "my-optimized-images"

        // Responsive widths (pixels) for generated image variants.
        // Default: [480, 640, 768, 1024, 1280, 1536]
        options.Sizes = [480, 768, 1024, 1280]; // Adjust to your common breakpoints

        // Default image quality (15‚Äì100). Lower means more compression.
        // Default: 75 | Recommended: 70‚Äì80 for a good balance.
        options.DefaultQuality = 75;

        // Default image output format (jpeg, png, webp, avif).
        // Default: webp | Recommended: FileFormat.webp (efficient and widely supported).
        options.DefaultFileFormat = FileFormat.webp;
    });
    ```

3.  **Map Middleware:**
    Ensure the BlazorImage runtime is mapped in `Program.cs` to serve the optimized files. 

    ```csharp
    // Add this line to serve optimized images
    app.MapBlazorImageRuntime();

    // ... other app configurations
    // app.Run();
    ```

4.  **Include Required Assets:**
    Include the BlazorImage stylesheet and script within your `App.razor` file:

    **CSS (in `<head>`):**
    Your project's main scoped CSS file should be included.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="YourAppName.styles.css" />
    ```

    **JS (before closing `</body>` tag):**

    ```html
    <script src="_content/BlazorImage/BlazorImage.min.js"></script>
    ```

### üìä Dashboard Endpoint (Optional)

BlazorImage offers a dashboard to manage the image cache, which is especially handy during development.

Enable it in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
#if DEBUG // Recommended to enable only in development
app.MapBlazorImageDashboard("/blazor-image-admin"); // Choose your preferred path
#endif
```

You can then access it at the path you defined (e.g., `/blazor-image-admin`).

## The `<Image>` Component

The `<Image>` component is how you'll interact with BlazorImage in your `.razor` files.

```razor
<Image Src="/images/my-photo.jpg" Alt="A clear description of the image" Width="300" Height="200" />
```

> **Styling Note:** When applying styles, use the `CssClass` parameter instead of `class`, and `Style` instead of `style`.

### Key `<Image>` Component Parameters

  * **`Src`** (string, required): Path to the original image file (relative to `wwwroot`).
  * **`Alt`** (string, required): Alternative text for accessibility and SEO.
  * **`Fill`** (bool, optional): If `true`, the image fills its parent container while preserving its aspect ratio (like `object-fit: cover`). Defaults to `false`. `Width` and `Height` are often best used with `Fill="false"` or when `AspectRatio` is also set.
  * **`Width`, `Height`** (int?, optional): Desired image dimensions in pixels.
  * **`Priority`** (bool, optional): If `true`, the image loads eagerly (disables lazy loading) and can enable preload linking. Ideal for critical above-the-fold images. Defaults to `false`.
  * **`DefaultSrc`** (string, optional): Path to a fallback image if `Src` fails to load, overriding default error messages.
  * **`Quality`** (int?, optional): Sets the optimized image quality (15‚Äì100). Overrides the global library setting.
  * **`Format`** (`FileFormat?` enum, optional): Specifies the desired output image format (e.g., `FileFormat.webp`, `FileFormat.jpeg`). *Note: AVIF generation can be resource-intensive.*
  * **`Sizes`** (string, optional): The `sizes` attribute for the `<img>` tag, guiding the browser in selecting responsive sources.
  * **`CssClass`** (string, optional): CSS classes for the `<img>` tag.
  * **`Style`** (string, optional): Inline styles for the `<img>` tag.
  * **`Caption`** (string, optional): Text displayed as a caption below the image.
  * **`CaptionClass`** (string, optional): CSS classes for the image caption.
  * **`AspectRatio`** (`(int, int)` optional): Defines the aspect ratio (e.g., `@(16,9)` for 16:9). Particularly useful with `Fill="true"` to maintain proportions.
  * **`EnableInteractiveState`** (bool, optional): Enables state-based interactivity (e.g., loading/error visual cues).
  * **`Id`** (string, optional): Sets a custom ID for the image element. Useful for anchoring, JavaScript interaction, or enabling preload links with `Priority="true"`.
  * **`AdditionalAttributes`** (`Dictionary<string, object>`, optional): A way to pass any other HTML attributes directly to the `<img>` tag.

## üìò Usage Examples

**1. Responsive Image Filling a Container:**

```razor
<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: 350px;">
    <Image Src="/images/wide-banner.jpg" Alt="Promotional Banner" Fill="true" />
</div>
```

**2. Static Dimensions (e.g., Icon or Logo):**

```razor
<Image Src="/images/app-icon.png" Alt="Application Icon" Width="64" Height="64" />
```

**3. Eager Loading for a Hero Image with Preload:**
To preload an image, set an `Id` and `Priority="true"`. Then, use `SectionOutlet` in your `<HeadContent>`.

```razor
<HeadContent>
    <SectionOutlet SectionName="hero-image-id" /> {/* Outlet for the preload link */}
</HeadContent>

<Image Id="hero-image-id" {/* Unique ID for the image */}
       Priority="true"   {/* Enables eager loading and preload link generation */}
       Src="/images/hero-main.jpg"
       Alt="Main hero image for the page"
       Width="1200"
       Height="600" />
```

**4. Custom Format and Quality:**

```razor
<Image Src="/images/detail-shot.png"
       Alt="Detailed product shot"
       Format="FileFormat.png"
       Quality="90"
       Width="800"
       Height="600" />
```

**5. Using `Sizes` Attribute for Fine-Grained Responsiveness:**
Ideal with utility CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

```razor
<Image Src="/images/user-avatar.jpg"
       Alt="User Avatar"
       Sizes="(max-width: 768px) 4rem, 8rem" {/* 4rem on small screens, 8rem otherwise */}
       CssClass="rounded-full object-cover"
       Fill="true"
       Priority="true" />
```

**6. Maintaining Aspect Ratio with `Fill`:**

```razor
<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;">
    <Image Src="/images/landscape-photo.jpg"
           Alt="Scenic landscape"
           AspectRatio="@(16,9)"
           Fill="true" />
</div>
```

**7. Image with a Caption:**

```razor
<Image Src="/images/figure1.jpg"
       Alt="Figure 1 showing data flow"
       Caption="Figure 1: Data flow diagram."
       CaptionClass="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1 text-center"
       Width="650" Height="400" />
```
