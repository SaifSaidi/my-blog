## Supercharge Your Blazor App: Effortless Image Optimization with BlazorImage

In today's web development landscape, optimizing images is crucial for delivering fast and engaging user experiences. Large, unoptimized images can significantly slow down your Blazor applications, leading to frustrated users and poor SEO rankings.

### Getting Started with BlazorImage

Ready to unlock the power of BlazorImage in your Blazor application? Here's a step-by-step guide:

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **.NET 9.0** or a higher version installed. You can download it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

#### Installation

Install the BlazorImage NuGet package by adding the following line to your project's `.csproj` file within the `<ItemGroup>` tag:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="BlazorImage" Version="1.0.1" />
```

Then, add the BlazorImage namespace to your `_Imports.razor` file:

```csharp
@using BlazorImage
```

#### Setup Services

Open your `Program.cs` file and register the BlazorImage services within the `ConfigureServices` method:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddBlazorImage();
```

##### Optional Endpoints (Development Stage)

During development, you can enable endpoints to manage the image cache. Add the following to your `Program.cs` file within the `Configure` method:

```csharp
app.MapBlazorImage("/blazor/images");
```

##### Configuration

Customize BlazorImage to fit your specific needs by providing configuration options during service registration:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddBlazorImage(options =>
{
    // Default quality for processed images (15-100). Default Value = 75
    options.DefaultQuality = 80;

    // Default file format for processed images (e.g., "webp", "jpeg"). Default is "webp"
    options.DefaultFileFormat = FileFormat.webp;

    // Path for storing processed images. Default is "_blazor"
    options.Dir = "_output";

    // Array of sizes for image configuration. Default [480, 640, 768, 1024, 1280, 1536] sizes
    options.ConfigSizes = new int[] { 640, 1024, 1280 };

    // Aspect ratio width for images. Default is 1.0
    options.AspectWidth = 1.0;

    // Aspect ratio height for images. Default is 1.0
    options.AspectHeight = 1.0;

    // Absolute expiration time relative to now for cached images. Default is 720 hours (30 days).
    options.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromHours(720);

    // Sliding expiration time for cached images. Default is null.
    options.SlidingExpiration = null;
});
```

#### Usage in Your Components

Now you can start using the `Image` and `Picture` components in your Blazor pages and components.

##### Add Script and CSS

In your `App.razor` file, add the following script and link within the `<head>` or `<body>`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Your Blazor App</title>
    <base href="/" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="YourProjectName.styles.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="_content/BlazorImage/BlazorImage.min.css" /> </head>
<body>
    <Routes />
    <script src="_framework/blazor.web.js"></script>
    <script src="_content/BlazorImage/BlazorImage.min.js"></script> </body>
</html>
```

**Note:** Replace `YourProjectName` with the actual name of your Blazor project.

##### Using the `Image` Component

The `Image` component is the primary way to display optimized images. Here's an example:

```html
<Image Src="images/my-image.jpg"
       Alt="A beautiful landscape"
       Width="800"
       Height="600"
       LazyLoading="true"
       Title="Landscape View"
       CssClass="rounded-image"
       WrapperClass="image-container"
       Style="border: 1px solid #eee;"
       WrapperStyle="margin-bottom: 20px;"
       Quality="75"
       Format="FileFormat.webp"
       Sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 800px"
       EnableDeveloperMode="true" />
```

##### Using the `Picture` Component

For more advanced scenarios with multiple image sources (e.g., for different breakpoints or image formats), you can use the `Picture` component:

```html
<Picture Src="images/main-image.jpg"
         Alt="Product Showcase"
         Width="1200"
         Height="900"
         LazyLoading="true"
         Title="Our Latest Product"
         CssClass="product-image"
         WrapperClass="product-wrapper"
         Style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"
         WrapperStyle="text-align: center;"
         Quality="85"
         Format="FileFormat.avif"
         Sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 80vw, 1200px"
         CaptionClass="image-caption"
         Caption="Introducing our revolutionary product!"
         EnableDeveloperMode="false" />
```
